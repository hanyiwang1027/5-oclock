        <p>
            In my early teenage years, I visited an island far away from home. 
            A rainy place, with red foxes burning in the grassland like fire. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Delving through the layers of Capital, I was lost in the repetition 
            of terraced houses, pigeons, and brick pavement. Cemeteries downtown 
            were quite an odd scene - but I later found out it was common practice 
            in many other lands. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Riding on a bus, I finally saw the giant clock tower. Well-known around 
            the world, the building had an unreal glow on a rainy afternoon, much 
            like the pictures I saw in a hundred different places. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Maybe it was when I was walking on a bridge on a misty morning that I 
            saw the big clock. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Or a drizzling noon when crossing the street.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            After countless encounters with photos of the building in countless 
            times and angles, I can no longer tell which glimpse belongs to my 
            true experience. Or the clock itself was, overall, a construction of 
            memories.
